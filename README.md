# IS211_FinalProject
For my final project I developed a web application using the following: python 3.7, Flask, HTML, SQLite3, and Beautifulsoap4 web scrapping. Since it is the holiday season and many people are out shopping, the website is called Black Friday Deals.  The site will display merchandise sorted by categories with its sale price. The merchandise will be pulled from the actual website https://blackfriday.com. When a customer comes to the site, they will need to register by creating an account. After registration youâ€™ll be able to login and view merchandise and add it to the basket for purchase.  Items will be displayed in the basket will total price next to it.
